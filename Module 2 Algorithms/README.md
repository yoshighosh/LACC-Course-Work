# Algorithms
Exercises utilizing different types of algorithms (i.e. Greedy Algorithm) to solve different problems (i.e. Travelling Salesmen Problem)

## Files

> Sorting Examples
- Compares a BubbleSort to the Python Sort (which uses the TimSort Algorithm) by calculating the runtime.

> Travelling Salesman
- Simple program that utilizes a Greedy Algorithm to solve the Travelling Salesman problem. This problem asks to find the shortest path to visit all the cities and return home. The Greedy Algorithm finds the closest place to its current location and visits that city.
